code examples of TF-IDF and KNN algorithms, and two datasets for documents classification.

(1) extract tf-idf features  of documents; 
(2) apply the machine learning algorithms such as KNN, logistic regression and NN and build a classifier on the features; 
(3) report the accuracy and F1 scores.

also build more advanced classifier models on the same datasetswith word2vec, LSTM and transformer .
